# Object Detection and Segmentation on the Jetson TX2 and Desktop

## About this repository
Original code taken from naisy's realtime_object_detection [here](https://github.com/naisy/realtime_object_detection). 

 
Project focused on implenting and profiling [Faster RCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497.pdf) and [Mask RCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06870.pdf) for the Jetson TX2 using TF->TRT.

The video used for testing the networks can be found [here](https://www.videvo.net/video/los-angeles-busy-freeway/5130/).

Videos of the results from both the desktop and Jetson TX2 implementation can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9ldl26pslppua2x/AADdtbk6nDuQsqumnQv0KvJYa?dl=0) along with the report to go along with this project.
